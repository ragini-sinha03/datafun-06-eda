### I covered the following topics in the course on eda analysis

## Created a project and cloned to the machine:
#### I created a new repository on GitHub. I make sure README.md was checked to document about the project.
#### I opened the file explorer on my computer where I stored my file and then opened the terminal for that file. 
#### I cloned the repository to that folder using below listed command.

git clone site_URL

## Added files:
#### I added main.py, requirements.txt to hold the required modules, .venv to act as the virtual environment, and .gitignore to hold the .venv and .vscode files. 

## Created virtual environment for the project:
#### I created and activated a virtual environment for the project by using the listed command.
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate

## Installed the required packages into local project virtual environment
#### I installed the required packages that are held in the requirement.txt file-requests

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
